Yes you will drop quite a bit of money eating here but if you are one of those who live to eat then Sixteen is a must. The tasting menu changes quarterly and each plate has a fantastic wine pairing.

I went there to celebrate a super special occasion but it was nothing impressive but the view. I grown up from a Chef family so I appreciate great food and services. I have to admit Im not a big fan of their tasting menu. I was not impress with the food but the presentation was good. Dont get me wrong they were good but not person good. And you do get many more small tasting items extra from your orders. But I just feel it should be about the food not just using big words to describe the food.
